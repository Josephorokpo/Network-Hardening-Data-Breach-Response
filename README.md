# **Network Hardening for Data Breach Response**

## **Project Introduction**

This project details a simulated cybersecurity incident involving a major data breach at a social media organization, resulting in compromised customer personal information. As a security analyst, my task was to identify critical network vulnerabilities and propose specific network hardening methods to prevent future attacks and strengthen the organization's overall security posture. This exercise demonstrates practical application of network security principles and risk mitigation strategies.

## **Methodology and Analysis**

The incident began with a major data breach impacting customer data. My investigation involved inspecting the organization's network to uncover existing vulnerabilities. Based on the identified weaknesses, I selected and justified specific network hardening tools and methods that could be consistently implemented to address these vulnerabilities and enhance long-term security.

My methodology involved:

1. **Vulnerability Identification:** Reviewing the provided scenario to pinpoint the four major network vulnerabilities present in the organization.  
2. **Tool/Method Selection:** Choosing up to three relevant network hardening tools and methods from a provided list that directly address the identified vulnerabilities.  
3. **Recommendation Formulation:** Developing a detailed explanation for each chosen method, outlining its effectiveness and frequency of implementation.  
4. **Risk Assessment & Documentation:** Consolidating the findings and recommendations into a structured security risk assessment report.

## **Security Risk Assessment & Recommendations**

A detailed security risk assessment, including the identified vulnerabilities, proposed hardening methods, and explanations of their effectiveness, is provided in the Security\_Risk\_Assessment.md file within this repository.

## **Key Learnings**

This activity reinforced the importance of:

* Proactive identification of common network vulnerabilities.  
* Understanding various network hardening techniques and their application.  
* The critical role of layered security, combining technical controls with policy enforcement.  
* Developing practical, actionable recommendations for improving an organization's security posture.  
* The continuous nature of cybersecurity, requiring consistent implementation and maintenance of security measures.
